# Redwood
Redwood is a toy programming language interpreted in C#.

Redwood is being made to experiment with the concept of persisted closures,
which is where the program state from a closured lambda used as a callback can
be serialized and then rehydrated at a later time, potentially in a different
context or on a different machine.

However, the development of this language is still in early development and it
lacks the groundwork necessary to implement these features at the moment.
